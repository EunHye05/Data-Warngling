# Data-Warngling

## Introduction

The Data Wrangling project is to perform data wrangling process by gathering, assessing and testing. Specifically for this project, I will wangle “WeRateDogs”, which is from Twitter data. After the gathering process, when accessing gathered data, I will be focused on its quality and tidiness. After data is gathered and accessed, I will then move forward to cleaning process. This process includes define, code and test. At the end of this project I will have cleaned data.

### Gathering

For the project I gathered 3 datasets from difference sources they are:
1. “WeRateDogs” from Twitter
2. Image prediction file from Udacity
3. Data retrieved by Twitter’s API 

### Assessing

Assessing data is important part to make clean and tidy data. Data were assessed either programmatically and visually and I looked for their quality and tidiness issues. 

### Cleaning

Define, Code and Test steps were used in cleaning process. 

### Conclusion

By gathering, assessing and cleaning data we can have cleaned and tidy data to work on. As a final result, I detected 12 quality and tidiness issues and they were all fixed.
