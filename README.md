# Data-Warngling

## Introduction

The Data Wrangling project is to perform data wrangling process by gathering, assessing and testing. Specifically for this project, I will wangle “WeRateDogs”, which is from Twitter data. After the gathering process, when accessing gathered data, I will be focused on its quality and tidiness. After data is gathered and accessed, I will then move forward to cleaning process. This process includes define, code and test. At the end of this project I will have cleaned data.
